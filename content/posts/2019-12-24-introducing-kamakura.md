    Hello, Thank you for giving me a great chance to guide guests in Japan. I am Kaoru Mitsumori.<br />I will introduce Kamakura and area spreading to Enoshima, which is called Shonan. It&#8217;s my favorite place. I love Kamakura. I visited there many times since I moved to Tokyo.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Kamakura is an attractive town blessed with historical heritage such as many shrines and temples and rich natural environment such as the sea and mountains.<br />In a local street, there are well-kept hedges and flowers, so you can feel the season and Japanese culture. Everything is the charm of Kamakura.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are three attractions in Kamakura.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first is nature. Kamakura is a city full of nature, both the sea and the mountains. On holidays, there are many people enjoying in these environments and refresh their bodies and hearts.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The second is history. Kamakura is also famous as the place where Yoritomo Minamoto opened the shogunate. If excavation is conducted now, buried cultural assets from the Kamakura period may still come out. I want you to feel the history scattered throughout Kamakura.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The third is the townscape. The attractive local railway, Enoden is running along the sea, there is quiet residential area, and a vibrant shopping street is spreading around the station. I love Kamakura in the point that the historical building with the atmosphere is in it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I recommend &#8220;Tsuruoka Hachimangu&#8221; Shrine, where you can witness a history. It might be a little common to visit there. You should go once.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And one more thing there is a special spot, honesty I don&#8217;t want many people know it.<br /><br />It is &#8220;bills,&#8221; a cafeteria very close to a coastline. When you&#8217;re seated on a sofa, you&#8217;ll be impressed by the contrast between white of floor or wall and flat blue of beautiful sky and ocean outside.<br />It&#8217;s nothing but breathtaking. If sun is setting, you&#8217;re lucky. You can witness Mt.Fuji with flat red sky. It was most overwhelming scenery in my life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am looking forward to taking a walk there, in Kamakura with guests,<br /><br />Thank you!
  </p>
